## Intro

3D printers are awesome machines, but they come with a variety of limitations:

First: the printed object is mostly small. Prints are always smaller than the printer itself. So if you want to make big prints, you need a big printer and even with this big printer are the possibilities limited.

Second: When the printer is finished printing your object, human interaction is needed to proceed the next print. The printer isn’t able to remove the printed object and start a new one.


To produce parts fast and cost-effectively, I’ve designed a printer that can print many parts sequentially. Not only will it be more costeffective than other printers, it will be fairly easy to reproduce the printer with a minimal need of tools. I tried to make as many parts as possible with tools that are accessible in a FabLab.

The printer uses a conveyor belt as print bed, whereas a normal printer uses a fixed build plate. A belt as printbed enables the printer to roll off the object and start printing a new one and it make it possible to make objects that are (almost) Infinite in 1 direction.

## Configuration 1 (Infinite printing)

In this configuration, It's possible to make objects with one infinite dimention.
The X,Y-assembly is oriented under an 45 degree angle towards the bed assembly.
This is especially usefull for extrusions, but it makes it also possible to print objects without support wereas normal printers would need support.

## Configuration 2 (Normal 3D printer with automated object rejection)

This configuration give you all the advantages of the standard XYZ setup with the addition of automaticly rejection of the print. It makes it possible to print many objects, without the need of human interaction between diffrent objects.


##
This printer is fully custom made, every part is carefully designed to make sure the machine will work as good as possible.

On this Github page, you can find all the details about this printer. I share all the designfiles as well as software, firmware and used parts.
